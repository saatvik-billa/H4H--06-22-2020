        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="row">
            <h2>Q1: Can I include my donation(s) on my taxes?</h2>
            <h3>For Monetary Beneficiaries:</h3>
            <p>Yes! Each monetary beneficiary on our website has tax-exempt status, 
                so your donation to any monetary beneficiary can be included on your taxes. 
                The way it works is after you donate, you will receive an email from the 
                beneficiary that includes a thank you message along with information that 
                you can use for tax purposes.</p>
            <h3>For PPE Beneficiaries:</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, at the moment, no. Donations to PPE Beneficiaries come 
                directly to Hero For Hero, which we then use to buy masks and gloves 
                for the workers at these organizations. At the moment we do not have 
                tax-exempt status but are working on the application needed to be 
                submitted to the IRS in order to gain said status. Please do not let 
                this deter you from donating to PPE Beneficiaries because they are in 
                great need of gloves and masks and your donations towards them would 
                greatly help the cause.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h2>Q2: How will I know if my funds have been received by the organization?</h2>
            <h3>For Monetary Beneficiaries:</h3>
            <p>Immediately after your donation, an automated email from 
                the monetary beneficiary that you selected will appear in your 
                inbox, thanking you for your gracious donation and in turn confirming 
                that they received the funds.</p>
            <h3>For PPE Beneficiaries:</h3>
            <p>Donations towards PPE Beneficiaries will go towards Hero For Hero, 
                where we will take the total amounts for each organization in this 
                category and buy masks and gloves for the frontline/social workers. 
                1-2 minutes after you donate, you will receive a receipt from SquareUp 
                confirming that your donation was successful. In the next couple of 
                weeks, volunteers associated with Hero For Hero will personally visit 
                each organization and deliver the masks and gloves. Photos will be 
                posted on our social media accounts, which will be activated before 
                we deliver the equipment.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <h2>Q3: Are we adding more recipient organizations?</h2>
            <p>Yes! Our team at Hero For Hero is actively researching and recruiting 
                the non-profit organizations in Austin that need the most support. By mid-July, 
                we aim to have more than fifteen PPE beneficiaries and more than ten Monetary 
                Beneficiaries. If you are part of a non-profit organization that could benefit 
                from being a part of our website, please email us at alwaysh4h@gmail.com and we 
                will respond with information on how to get set up.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <h2>Q4: Who are we and what do we get out of this?</h2>
            <p>Hero For Hero is a nonprofit organization founded by Saatvik Billa, 
                a rising senior at Westwood High School. Hero For Hero doesn't make 
                any profit or take any cuts from donations, but rather just facilitates 
                transactions between the donor and recipient organization. When donating 
                to a PPE organization, the funds do come to Hero For Hero, but we use 
                every single penny donated to buy gloves and masks for the beneficiaries selected.</p>
